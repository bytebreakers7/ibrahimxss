Lab-Tested and Field-Ready: Our tool has been rigorously tested in a variety of labs and real-world web applications. It’s battle-hardened and ready to take on any challenge.
Support for DOM-Based XSS: DOM-based XSS attacks are on the rise, and the tool is equipped to identify and exploit these vulnerabilities effectively.
Path-Based XSS: Injecting payloads into the path of URLs is a common attack vector. Our tool allows for path-based testing with optional prefixes and suffixes.
JSON-Based XSS: JSON payloads are supported for POST requests, allowing for a deeper level of testing.
Multi-threading: The tool supports multi-threading, enabling simultaneous testing of multiple URLs to save time.
Intelligent URL Shuffling: When dealing with multiple URLs, the tool intelligently shuffles them to avoid detection and distribute requests evenly.
Resume Interrupted Scans: In case a scan is interrupted, you can resume from where you left off, ensuring thorough testing without duplication.
Customizable Delay: A delay can be set between requests to mimic human behavior and avoid triggering rate limits or detection mechanisms.
Timeout Management: Set maximum timeout values to ensure efficient testing without waiting indefinitely.
Zero False Positives: Trust in its accuracy and save valuable time by focusing only on real vulnerabilities.
Unique Innovation: Harness the power of advanced algorithms and techniques not found in other tools.
Flexible Detection Modes: Adapt to any scenario with customizable options for quick scans or deep analysis.
WAF Bypass: Evade Web Application Firewalls to ensure a true assessment of your web security.
Stealth Mode: Conduct scans discreetly without alerting potential intruders.
Over 2500 Encoded Payloads: Test a wide range of XSS attack vectors with a comprehensive library of payloads.
Customizable Payloads: Create and use tailored payloads for specific needs and scenarios.
Exportable Reports: Share detailed, professional reports with stakeholders, demonstrating the thoroughness and effectiveness of your security efforts.
XSS into all kinds of extensions: Expand your security coverage with support for various URL extensions.
Support for Various Web Technologies: Ensure comprehensive security across different platforms.
Continuous Updates: Stay ahead of evolving threats with regular updates to the tool.
High Performance: Optimized for speed and efficiency, delivering rapid and accurate results.
Automated Scanning: Schedule regular scans and maintain continuous security monitoring with minimal manual intervention.
Accurate Detection Algorithms: Minimize false positives with precise and reliable vulnerability detection.
Easy Configuration: User-friendly settings and intuitive controls for quick setup and scanning.
Advanced Search and Filter Options: Quickly locate specific vulnerabilities and focus on the most critical issues.
Rapid Deployment: Swift and efficient deployment with minimal setup requirements.
Using the #IBRAHIMXSS Tool
Getting started with the #IBRAHIMXSS Tool is straightforward. You can use command-line arguments to tailor your tests to your specific needs. Here are some examples:

To perform GET requests with custom payloads:
./xss-checker — get — urls urls.txt — payloads payloads.txt

2. To perform POST requests with custom headers and JSON payloads:

./xss-checker — post — request request.txt — payloads payloads.txt — json

3. To customize thread count and timeout values:

./xss-checker — get — urls urls.txt — payloads payloads.txt — threads 20 — timeout 8000

4. To inject payloads into URL paths with prefixes and suffixes:

./xss-checker — get — urls urls.txt — payloads payloads.txt — path — prefix 123 — suffix .html

5. And much much more options from the Tool…

Unmatched Accuracy and Recent Achievements
One of the standout features of the #IBRAHIMXSS Tool is its unparalleled accuracy. I take pride in the fact that my tool delivers a 100% success rate without generating false positives. It’s a testament to the dedication and expertise of my pentest team.
